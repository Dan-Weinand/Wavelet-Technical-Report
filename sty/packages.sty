\graphicspath{{./figures/}}

% Allows on-the-fly conversion of EPS figures to PDF.
% Needs to be loaded after the graphic{s,x} packages.
% Also, in order to make it work, you need to appropriately configure your
% LaTeX editor. For example, TexnicCenter needs to be configured as follows:
% Under Build | Define Output Profiles, in the arguments you pass to the 
% LaTeX command line compiler, append the following string: 
%  --shell-escape --synctex=1

% following usepackage line and replace \usepackage{icml2013} with
% \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2013} above. ICML 2013 specific.


% It is important for it to be the last package loaded.
% See http://www.tug.org/applications/hyperref/ftp/doc/manual.pdf
% Note: In case you get the ``\pdfendlink ended up in different nesting level than \pdfstartlink'' fatal error,
% this happens when hyperref is used under pdftex and a natbib citation splits across a page boundary. 
% See http://ftp.tug.org/mail-archives/pdftex/2002-February/002216.html
% To fix it, note the page number of the error and use the following instead:
