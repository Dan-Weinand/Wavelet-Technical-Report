\newcommand{\FIT}{Florida Institute of Technology}
\newcommand{\ECE}{Department of Electrical \& Computer Engineering} 

% Macros for "i.e." and "e.g.". To prevent LaTeX from adding space after the 
% last period, use these macros as ``\ie\'' and ``\eg\''.
\newcommand{\ie}{\textit{i.e.}}
\newcommand{\eg}{\textit{e.g.}}

%%% Acronym definitions; feel free to add your own.
%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Acronyms (requires ``acronym'' package in packages.sty)
% Use ``\ac{<ACRONYM>}'' in the text to refer to an acronym. The first time 
% LaTeX will encounter it, it will expand it to its full text and the acronym in 
% parentheses. After that point, if it encounters it again, it will just write 
% out the acronym.
%
% Use ``\acfi{<ACRONYM>}'' in the same was as ``\ac'', but the expanded acronym 
% will be in italics.
%
% Use ``\acl{<ACRONYM>}'' to printout its expanded version without the acronym 
% in parentheses. 
%
% Use ``\acp{<ACRONYM>}'' to printout the plural form of the acronym.
%
% Use ``\acresetall'' to reset the ``memory'' of the acronym package. After its 
% occurence, LaTeX behaves as if it encounters an acronym for the first time in 
% the text.  
%
% Read the documentation, if you need acronyms in titles or a list of acronyms.
