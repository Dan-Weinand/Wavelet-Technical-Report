In this section we see how the estimator performs at describing the potentially
 non-stationary relationship between the daily change of a stock's price
 and the volume at which it was traded.

Stocks and the volatility/volume relationship
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stock traders must walk a delicate balance between risk and reward.
 Low risk investments may bring in a small trickle of steady income but
 have little chance of making large gains.
 On the other hand, high risk investments are often paired with the potential
 for huge profits.
 A properly diversified investment portfolio has some combination of the
 two types of investments according to the manager's personal concern for
 massive loss versus above average gain.
 There are a variety of factors which influence the risk of a given investment.
 For example, startup companies tend to have a higher chance for failure
 but also increase their stock prices much more than an established company
 if they succeed.
 Other risk factors are time dependent; making trades during a market crash
 carries much more uncertainty than trading during more normal periods.

One well established risk relationship is that the volume of a stock being
 traded tends to correlate with that stock's absolute change in price

.
 To put it another way, if a stock is being exchanged at unusually large
 volumes it is very likely that its price has gone up or down by a significant
 amount.
 Two competing theories exist to account for this phenomenon.
 In the first, variance of daily price change is viewed as the sum of a
 random number of intra-day price changes.
 The variance of daily price change is then correlated with the number of
 transactions occurring that day
