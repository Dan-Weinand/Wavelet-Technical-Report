Stock trading: the variability/volume relationship
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stock traders are constantly seeking more efficient ways to mitigate risks
 and increase profits on their investments.
 ; Low risk investments may bring in a small trickle of steady income but
 have little chance of making large gains.
 On the other hand, high risk investments are often paired with the potential
 for huge profits.
 A properly diversified investment portfolio has some combination of the
 two types of investments according to the manager's personal concern for
 massive loss versus above average gain.
 There are a variety of factors which influence the risk of a given investment.
 For example, startup companies tend to have a higher chance for failure
 but also increase their stock prices much more than an established company
 if they succeed.
 Other risk factors are time dependent; making trades during a market crash
 carries much more uncertainty than trading during more normal periods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One well established risk relationship is that the volume of a stock being
 traded tends to correlate with that stock's absolute change in price
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Tauchen83"

\end_inset

.
 To put it another way, if a stock is being exchanged at unusually large
 volumes it is very likely that its price has gone up or down by a significant
 amount.
 The result of this is that trading on particularly high volume days entails
 a great deal of risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two competing theories exist to account for the volume versus variability
 correlation.
 In the first, variance of daily price change is viewed as the sum of a
 random number of intra-day price changes.
 The variance of daily price change is then correlated with the number of
 transactions occurring that day 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "Clark73"

\end_inset

.
 The second model assumes a positive relationship between how much traders
 disagree when revising their reservation prices and the absolute change
 in the stock's market price.
 The volume versus variability relationship springs from the correlation
 between trading volume and trader disagreement in revising reservation
 prices

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the underlying process for the phenomenon, traders need to
 keep the volume versus variability relation in mind when examining the
 risk of trading.
 Knowledge of how this relationship varies over time could give traders
 a better sense of the risk they accept when trading on high volume days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Data and preprocessing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Original data comes from the historical stock data set on Quant Quote (https://q
uantquote.com/historical-stock-data) on June 9th, 2014.
 The raw data contained the following variables: the Date, Ticker (which
 comes from the file name), Open, High, Low, Close, Volume for the day.
 We use the 50 stocks with most complete information in the Quant Quote
 set (completeness was decided by the size of the data file for the company).
 Since this selects for companies which lasted the roughly 14 year period
 (late 1998 until early 2013), survivorship bias is a potential source of
 error in our subsequent analyses.
 To put it another way, it is possible that the following analyses only
 hold for companies which will not dissolve in the immediate future.
 Thus, if these techniques were used with modern companies (which may dissolve
 soon) then different results may be generated.

Since the raw price for the various companies was frequently very different,
 it was necessary to normalize the data by examining the percent price change
 instead of the original price.
 Likewise, different stocks are traded at radically varying volumes and
 these volumes are largely time dependent.
 In order to account for this, we use the standard technique of taking the
 logarithm of the individual company data.
 After this, we fit a linear model to the log trading volume versus time
 and examine the residuals

\begin_layout Standard
In order to keep the two variables on the same scale for the eventual density
 estimator, both were recentered about their mean and then divided by their
 standard deviation.
 We are, therefore, simply working with the variables in terms of their
 standard deviations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
A new heuristic for the selection of the resolution level and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The true density distribution over the two variables (trading volume residuals
 and percent price change) is not known a priori.
 We do however, believe that the distribution exhibits a certain degree
 of smoothness.
 This smoothness can be controlled via the resolution level (
\begin_inset Formula $j_{0}$
\end_inset

) of the estimator.
 Further, we believe that the distribution does not change instantaneously
 so that the current density should be indicative of points in the immediate
 future.
 The speed of the estimator's response to changes in the underlying distribution
 can be controlled by the aging parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 We opted for the exponential decay model rather than the windowing method
 as it seems reasonable that stock data is most closely related to data
 immediately previous to it with a slow decay of this relationship over
 time.
 The windowing method would assume an equal relation between data points
 for a fixed period of time after which there is utterly no relation, a
 rather odd idea for real world data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We wish to select the 'best' pair (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,j_{0}$
\end_inset

) for our data.
 We define the 'best' estimator as the one for which the sum of the log
 probabilities of the incoming points is maximized.
 Describing the heuristic in more depth, each time we take a point in from
 the data set and calculate its probability given the current density model,
 take the log of that value, and then add it to the model's total score.
 This method can be applied to the entire dataset (as we did) or one can
 use a subset of the data.
 The major advantage of using a subset of the data would be speed as the
 heuristic seems fairly robust to overfitting.
 Choosing the model with the least negative total score selects for effectivenes
s at predicting future data.
 It is possible to run the model with several combinations of the parameters
 in parallel in order to select the best combination when analyzing real-time
 streaming data.
 From Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 it can be seen that the optimal parameters for this data set were a 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{0}$
\end_inset

 of 1 and a 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 of .9995.

 In other words, how much information does the stock trading volume give
 about the probable price change at a given point in time.
 Figure

 shows the evolution of this metric over time.
 At first glance, it seems difficult to extract much useful knowledge from
 the raw graph.
 However, the sharpest peak corresponds to the August 2011 United States
 debt ceiling crisis while the most noticeable trough occurs during the
 period directly following the September 2008 stock market crash.
 Other features of the chart may very well correspond to significant periods
 for the market, but we limit our analysis to highlighting the two most
 noticeable periods.

 The contrast between the two plots is stark, suggesting that a large amount
 of information about stock price changes can be determined from that stock's
 trading volume for that day.
 This agrees with literature reporting a noticeable relationship between
 stock trading volume and price variability.
 It is worth noting that the initial spike seen in both plots corresponds
 to the 'learning' period of the density estimation model and can be safely
 ignored.

 They are a contract which gives the buyer the option to purchase (in the
 case of a put) or sell (in the case of a call) a stock at a fixed price
 at some point in the future.
 It is worth noting that the decision of whether or not to exercise the
 option remains in the buyer's hands, so obviously it will only be used
 if it is profitable to do so.
 If an option would be profitable to exercise, it is said to be

 Options are extremely high risk, if a put is made and the stock price goes
 down then the put will be worthless.
 This is in contrast to a true stock, which will retain most of its worth
 even during a significant crisis.
 On the other hand, options present massive opportunities for profit particularl

\begin_layout Standard
It is generally expected that the ratio between puts and calls stay relatively
 close to 1.
 Large positive (or negative) deviations from this value suggest that the
 stock's price is expected to increase (decrease) strongly in the future,
 and if this expectation is widespread it will affect both the price of
 puts (calls) as well as the price of underlying stock which will work to
 bring the ratio back into balance.
 Worth noting, however, is that the ratio will generally be slightly lower
 than 1 (closer to .93) due to the use of calls acting as short positions
 to hedge the mostly long positions widely held in the market.
 For example, if a mutual fund holds a large amount of Apple stock they
 could reduce their risk exposure by purchasing calls on Apple stock.
 If Apple's stock price goes up, the fund sees profit through increase in
 the stock price but the call becomes worthless.
 On the other hand, if the price of Apple's stock falls then the fund will
 lose money from the actual stocks they hold but receive profit from selling
 the call.
 This shows how puts can reduce overall risk exposure at the cost of reducing
 expected profit.

 The option data has far fewer points per period of time when compared to
 the stock price data.
 As such, we could predict that if the two distributions change a roughly
 equal amount over the same period of time then the option data should require
 a lower 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 Further, other researchers 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

 have noted that the more rapid the aging the lower the resolution must
 be to compensate.
 This is due to the fact that a higher resolution level demands a larger
 data in order to not be dominated by noise and more rapid aging reduces
 the effective size of the data set the estimator uses at a point in time.
 The optimal levels chosen for the trading fulfill these expectations.

 The results can be seen in Figure

.
 Several interesting trends come to mind during the initial observation
 of the plot.
 First would be the appearance a repeated up down cycle where each cycle
 lasts approximately 18 months.
 We are currently unaware of what financial activity might be causing this
 cycle but the topic deserves further investigation.
 Also worth noting is the sharp downward trend in the mutual information
 towards the present era.
 This seems to suggest that the relationship which was once held between
 the two variables is becoming weaker, which could be due to improved market
 efficiency.
 The increase in market efficiency is implied since there is information
 about the relative desire of puts or calls from the option trading volume,
 then any sellers incorporating this information into their option pricing
 would display increased profits.
 To be more concrete, if a seller knows that the current trading volume
 implies a high put/call ratio then that seller can increase their profit
 by increasing the price of puts and decreasing the price of calls.
 This increase in profit should lead to the majority of firms taking these
 trends into account, which would increase the price of the unusually desirable
 commodity and indirectly reduce the purchases of that commodity back to
 the expected ratio.
 A lower mutual information index could then imply increased market efficiency.
