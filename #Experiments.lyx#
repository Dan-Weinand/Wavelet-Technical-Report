\begin_layout Standard
In this section we see how the estimator performs at describing the potentially
 non-stationary relationship between the daily change of a stock's price
 and the volume at which it was traded.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Stocks and the variability/volume relationship
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Stock traders must walk a delicate balance between risk and reward.
 Low risk investments may bring in a small trickle of steady income but
 have little chance of making large gains.
 On the other hand, high risk investments are often paired with the potential
 for huge profits.
 A properly diversified investment portfolio has some combination of the
 two types of investments according to the manager's personal concern for
 massive loss versus above average gain.
 There are a variety of factors which influence the risk of a given investment.
 For example, startup companies tend to have a higher chance for failure
 but also increase their stock prices much more than an established company
 if they succeed.
 Other risk factors are time dependent; making trades during a market crash
 carries much more uncertainty than trading during more normal periods.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One well established risk relationship is that the volume of a stock being
 traded tends to correlate with that stock's absolute change in price
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Tauchen83"

\end_inset

.
 To put it another way, if a stock is being exchanged at unusually large
 volumes it is very likely that its price has gone up or down by a significant
 amount.
 The result of this is that trading on particularly high volume days entails
 a great deal of risk.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Two competing theories exist to account for the volume versus variability
 correlation.
 In the first, variance of daily price change is viewed as the sum of a
 random number of intra-day price changes.
 The variance of daily price change is then correlated with the number of
 transactions occurring that day 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "Clark73"

\end_inset

.
 The second model assumes a positive relationship between how much traders
 disagree when revising their reservation prices and the absolute change
 in the stock's market price.
 The volume versus variability relationship springs from the correlation
 between trading volume and trader disagreement in revising reservation
 prices 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Regardless of the underlying process for the phenomenon, traders need to
 keep the volume versus variability relation in mind when examining the
 risk of trading.
 Knowledge of how this relationship varies over time could give traders
 a better sense of the risk they accept when trading on high volume days.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Data and preprocessing
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Original data comes from the historical stock data set on Quant Quote (https://q
uantquote.com/historical-stock-data) on June 9th, 2014.
 The raw data contained the following variables: the Date, Ticker (which
 comes from the file name), Open, High, Low, Close, Volume for the day.
 We use the 50 stocks with most complete information in the Quant Quote
 set (completeness was decided by the size of the data file for the company).
 Since this selects for companies which lasted the roughly 14 year period,
 survivorship bias is a potential source of error in our subsequent analyses.

\begin_layout Standard
Since the raw price for the various companies was frequently very different,
 it was necessary to normalize the data by examining the percent price change
 instead of the original price.
 Likewise, different stocks are traded at radically varying volumes and
 these volumes are largely time dependent.
 In order to account for this, we use the standard technique of taking the
 logarithm of the individual company data.
 After this, we fit a linear model to the log trading volume versus time
 and examine the residuals

 This process can be seen in Figure

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to keep the two variables on the same scale for the eventual estimator,
 both were recentered about their mean and then divided by their standard
 deviation.
 We are, therefore, simply working with the variables in terms of their
 standard deviations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Selection of the resolution level and 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 value
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The true density distribution over the two variables (trading volume residuals
 and percent price change) is not known a priori.
 We do however, believe that the distribution exhibits a certain degree
 of smoothness.
 This smoothness can be controlled via the resolution level (
\begin_inset Formula $j_{0}$
\end_inset

) of the estimator.
 Further, we believe that the distribution does not change instantaneously
 so that the current density should be indicative of points in the immediate
 future.
 The speed of the estimator's response to changes in the underlying distribution
 can be controlled by the aging parameter 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

.
 We opted for the exponential decay model rather than the windowing method
 as it seems reasonable that stock data is most closely related to data
 immediately previous to it with a slow decay of this relationship over
 time.
 The windowing method would assume an equal relation between data points
 for a fixed period of time after which there is utterly no relation, a
 rather odd idea for real world data.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We wish to select the 'best' pair (
\begin_inset Formula $\theta,j_{0}$
\end_inset

) for our data.
 We define the 'best' estimator as the one for which the sum of the log
 probabilities of the incoming points is maximized.
 In more depth, each time we take a point in from the data set we calculated
 its probability given the current density model, take the log of that value,
 and then add it to the model's total score.
 This selects a model which is effective at predicting yet to be seen future
 data.
 From Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Theta-j0-selection"

\end_inset

 it can be seen that the optimal parameters were a 
\begin_inset Formula $j_{0}$
\end_inset

 of 1 and a 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 of .9995.

Analysis of volume/variability mutual information
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The model parameters selected as optimal by the validation scheme described
 above was run on the data set while computing the mutual information of
 the two variables every 100 samples.
 This gives a measure of how much the distribution of one variable is dependent
 on the value of the other.
 In other words, how much information does the stock trading volume give
 about the probable price change at a given point in time.
 Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Stock-Mutual-information"

\end_inset

 shows the evolution of this metric over time.
 At first glance, it seems difficult to extract much useful knowledge from
 the raw graph.
 However, the sharpest peak corresponds to the August 2011 United States
 debt ceiling crisis
