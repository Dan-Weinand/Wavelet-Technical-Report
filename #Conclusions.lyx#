As researchers, this project has improved our understanding of signal processing
, density estimation, nonparametric statistics, and many other areas.
 At the beginning of the experience, we were completely unfamiliar with
 the topic area 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The report covers the steps we took to address the problem of accurate and
 efficient density estimation for multi-dimensional, streaming data.
 Since streaming data has becoming increasingly common in applications ranging
 from stock trading to air pollution monitoring, our solution is highly
 desirable.
 The wavelet based approach we take allows for the efficient, online analysis
 of data from highly complex density distributions.
 The advantage of using wavelets are that we are able to model the heavy
 tails and sharp transitions in the density function.
 The algorithm used differs from batch based approaches in that it allows
 for the generating distribution to change over time, a major advantage
 in many applications.

Talk about more or less the journey you guys took.
 Give a sentence or two about the matlab implementation in all D's and java
 implementations in 1D and 2D.
 State why you did not pursue 3D Java.
 Give a line or two about the different areas that yoand how you finally
 settled on stock data.
 Give some personal tidbits or comments on the research project itself as
 a last line so the NSF people will feel as if you got something out of
 it, which I hope you did.

\begin_layout Standard
This project follows from a 1-dimensional Matlab prototype of the wavelet
 based density estimator.
 From there, we wrapped the algorithm in a Java application in order to
 take advantage of improved speed due to compilation and make the tool more
 accessible to data analysts.
 The next step was a 2-dimensional prototype in Matlab, followed by the
 extension of the Java application into the second dimension.
 We also implemented a 3-dimensional prototype in Matlab, but due to the
 lack of isosurface visualization support in Java (and most other major
 languages) we did not similarly extend the Java application.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Several data sets were initially considered in testing the application including
 pollution levels, cyber security attacks, and stock market data.
 We ultimately chose to use stock market data as the distribution has interestin
g nonparametric and nonstationary features.
 This analysis showed the estimator's responsiveness to changes over time,
 and displayed sharp deviations around major market changes which might
 be useful in predicting these changes in the future.
 The research team also wrapped the algorithm in a user friendly Java applicatio
n.
 This should vastly simplify density estimation for time dependent data.
 To date, a rigorous mathematical solution addressing the optimal speed
 for data aging and accuracy related to resolution level choice has not
 yet been proposed for non-stationary distributions,but would be an important
 future research topic.
 Such a solution would vastly simplify the wavelet density estimation process,
 which currently relies on user input for those parameters with only heuristics
 as a guide.
 Keeping this in mind, we also incorporated a new heuristic for the selection
 of these important parameters in order to facilitate a more data driven
 analysis.
